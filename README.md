I worked as a Russian language tutor for several years, and then -- as a teaching assistant at Reed College, Oregon in 2016-2017 academic year. I am currently in the first year of my MA in Russian Studies at McGill.
# My Research
Women Writers in Russian Literature of The First Half of Nineteenth
Century (1790-1840).

The works of women writers of the first half of the nineteenth century
were often disregarded by their contemporary critics and are largely
forgotten nowadays. Meanwhile, this period was essential for the
establishing of professional women’s writing.
By bringing into light and studying closely these works, along with
contextual materials, such as manuscripts, personal correspondence,
memoirs, and literary criticism, it will be possible to recreate the
personalized portraits of these authors to answer several important
and interconnected questions. How did education and social status
affect women’s writing and their views on literature? When did they
discover their professional potential in the field traditionally occupied
by men? What motivated men’s criticism on women’s writing? What
did it mean to be a female writer in the first half of nineteenth
century?
# My Objectives
So far, I've had very limited (if any) experience working with the digital humanities. However, in my previous research projects, I could often notice those limitations, never being able to overcome them for the lack of tools that I would know how to use effectively and appropriately. In this course, I hope to acquire new skills that will allow me to take my research to a new level; I am excited about new challenges and experiments.
